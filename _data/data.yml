    - name: Kafka Relay Server
      Language: Java
      date: Feb 2021 - May 2021
      description: |
            Oversaw the entire lifecycle of a data-forwarding server using Kafka to manage a data influx of 400,000 records per hour. Faced challenges when the producer's data rate exceeded the database consumption speed, causing server memory overflow. Optimized the database processing speed and segmented the Kafka server's consumption logic to resolve this. Implemented websocket for real-time data transmission from remote producers and utilized Kafka for streamlined data transfer and processing.

    - name: Clustering-based Web Crawler 
      Language: Python
      date: Feb 2022 - July 2022
      description: |
        Spearheaded the design of a specialized web crawler in a team of 6, aimed at extracting network data from specific domains. Utilized Selenium in Python for scraping and incorporated RabbitMQ for distributed IP pool management, ensuring optimal data collection.

    - name: Application of AI Image Recognition in Web Crawling
      Language: Python
      date: July 2022 - Dec 2022
      description: |
        Engineered an AI-powered solution to navigate challenges like verification codes during web crawling. Amassed a plethora of images via crawling, then harnessed PyTorch for training a visual model, boosting the crawler's efficiency by a remarkable 30%.

    - name: Centralized Management System for Bank Safes
      Language: Java
      date: Jan 2023 - April 2023
      description: |
        Collaborated with a team of 5 on the re-engineering and modernization of a legacy Safe Box Management System. Leveraged Java Spring as the primary framework and Oracle for backend operations. Assured flawless integration of the revamped system into the bank's extant platform. Realized optimizations using MyBatis for SQL commands and introduced advanced features such as visual usage ratio and risk control visualization. These interventions collectively propelled a substantial 18% surge in the system's response speed.

    - name: Langchain and Language Models Based Local Knowledge Base QA Application
      Language: Python
      date: April 2023 - Sep 2023
      description: |
        Collaboratively developed, in a team of 6, a localized Q&A application adhering to Langchain paradigms. Endeavored to fabricate a knowledge base Q&A tool fine-tuned for company contexts with the capability of offline operations via open-source language models. The workflow encompassed file loading, text processing, vectorization, question matching with top-k similar text vectors, and exploiting LLM to yield accurate answers founded on matched contexts. A major challenge involved the suboptimal accuracy of the embedding model, tackled effectively by gathering extensive data for bespoke training.
